A family &amp;#8211; Cherie and children aged 16 and 19 &amp;#8211; were in desperate fear of being deported and having to move in to a garage as they were losing their home.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We immediately contacted to offer support as we have with many others in the past and found they were long-standing members of move2nz. What was brilliant this time was that we were also able to review the immigration decision being made because Mike is now a licensed immigration adviser.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;The situation&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Cherie had been working in New Zealand for four years in an important and skilled job. She tried to renew her work visa in March and the immigration department (INZ) first confirmed they had everything they needed, but just two days before her visa was due to expire INZ insisted she produce a police clearance certificate from South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These certificates take months to obtain and Cherie&amp;#8217;s licensed immigration adviser had failed to remind her to get one. INZ refused to accept a declaration that Cherie had applied for the certificate which was strange as they had let her do so before, Cherie had not been back to SA since 2007 and her previous certificates had been completely clean.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This decision not to allow a declaration created a situation where two days later Cherie found herself with no visa, unlawful in New Zealand and subject to deportation. Of course this also meant that Cherie immediately lost her job as she no longer had the legal right to work in NZ. Cherie&amp;#8217;s 16 year old daughter also no longer had the right to go to school and was forced to stay home half-way through her year 12 studies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The family was now without a source of income and, as temporary visa holders, were not entitled to financial assistance. When the money ran out they started selling furniture to buy food.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When Cherie needed them most I am ashamed to say that her immigration adviser of four years refused to help because Cherie could not afford to pay the fees. On her own Cherie appealed the decision and then put in another visa application as she still had a full-time offer of skilled work. Both actions were declined.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;By mid May the family were in serious trouble being kicked out of their home and soon to be kicked out of New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Saving this situation&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Mike put his Licensed Immigration Adviser hat on and waded through a foot-high pile of papers to find out what had happened. I worked with the Ministry of Education to successfully get Cherie&amp;#8217;s daughter back to school.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Press newspaper ran a story about the Vermaak family and the Christchurch community responded with incredible generosity offering food, help with immigration costs and help with rent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It very quickly became clear to Mike reading this file that a mistake was being made by INZ and he negotiated for time to enable Cherie, a skilled worker, to find another job. INZ offered 6 weeks and said Cherie would have to leave if she did not have a job by this time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bizarrely, after having made a decision which effectively lost Cherie her job, INZ reversed it and agreed she could now enter a declaration relating to her police certificate if she found another job. Mike argued successfully for an extra month to give the 17 employers Cherie had applied to time to evaluate her application, but if Cherie did not have a job offer by 30th July she would have to leave New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;A chance to stay&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our own new immigration business was opening an office on August 13th and we were in the process of advertising for an Office Manager. Cherie applied for the job and, despite a month of advertising, was the only applicant with the skills we needed so we suddenly found ourselves able to offer her employment. This complicated things a bit but we submitted a Work Visa application which met every requirement on 23rd July.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The weeks ticked by with no news until 29th August when Mike received a letter from INZ. Cherie&amp;#8217;s application was again declined and she had to leave New Zealand immediately or be deported.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We were absolutely gutted, especially as no reason for declining was given. As we &lt;a class=&quot;boldLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.move2nz.com/member/showArticle.aspx?id=815&amp;amp;sm=g1000p1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;covered back in March&lt;/a&gt; INZ directs staff not to record the reasons for decisions on cases like this. Cherie was left with no right of appeal waiting for a deportation order to be issued which would send her and her children back to South Africa with nothing. Potentially living on the streets in South Africa was suddenly a terrifying but very real possibility.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;A final roll of the dice&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Mike immediately wrote a letter to the Associate Immigration Minister Kate Wilkinson asking if she would review this decision.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The minister can simply refuse to intervene and so Mike put together 8 pages of reasons why this situation was unfair to slow the deportation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the meantime Mike began pulling together hundreds of pages of documented proof to back this request up. It was our only chance and absolutely final hope. If the minister refused to look at the case it was all over.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On 8th September the Vermaak family were finally forced out of their home.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We couldn&amp;#8217;t see them living on the streets and so offered space in our own home, turning move2nz&amp;#8217;s office into a room that Cherie and her children could share. This was not ideal but the only option we had &amp;#8211; Mike and I couldn&rsquo;t have lived with ourselves if we didn&rsquo;t do everything in our power to support this family.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of course this wasn&amp;#8217;t the first time we have been in this position &amp;#8211; long term members will remember we opened our home to the Smith family of 4 back in June 2009, supporting them for 6 months while their appeal was heard, giving them the chance to gain residency and get back on their feet which they have successfully done.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;The Ministers decision &amp;#8211; Thursday 13th September&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On Thursday the decision came. This was much quicker than we had expected and Mike was only half-way through getting the documented proof ready. After putting over 400 hours of pro-bono work into this we thought this might be the end.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What we were delighted to read was that Kate Wilkinson had overturned the INZ&amp;#8217;s decision, granting each of the Vermaaks a 12 month visa to sort out their situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div style=&quot;border:#cccccc 1px solid;padding:3px;font-size:10px;float:right;margin-left:5px;font-style:italic;&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.move2nz.com/images/articles/845/vermaak1.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.move2nz.com/images/articles/845/vermaak1_sm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mike, Cherie and Tammy - copyright Dean Kozniac, Fairfax Media&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; height=&quot;113&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;(Click for enlargement)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is all they ever needed and we are so happy for this family. They will be staying with us for the time being, but we are now looking forward to watching them get back on their feet. As soon as Cherie has her visa she will be starting work as our Office Manager and helping us set up the New Zealand Immigration &amp;amp; Settlement Services office to be the best immigration consultancy in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;From a personal view this decision also means that Mike&amp;#8217;s 100% success rate on applications and appeals is reinstated and is a fantastic result for move2nz which will continue to help supporting this family.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I hope you will join with us in wishing this brave family the very best for the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;A few words from Mike&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Zealand&amp;#8217;s immigration system is built to be open, fair and help attract great people who have a lot to offer this country, but sometimes migrants who are acting in good faith fall between the cracks. In cases like this the Associate Minister of Immigration Kate Wilkinson is the only &amp;#8216;safety net&amp;#8217; to ensure decisions being made are fair and in New Zealand&amp;#8217;s best interests.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ms Vermaak&amp;#8217;s case is a perfect example where decisions made by other people combined to create a situation where, though no fault of her own, a valued worker in an important job was suddenly catapulted along with her children into a nightmare of losing her job, her home and everything she had worked for years to build.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In situations like this the Associate Minister acts as a vital safety net to ensure fair and just decisions are made, upholding the integrity of what is an excellent immigration system and protecting New Zealand&amp;#8217;s international reputation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On receiving our cry for help Kate Wilkinson moved swiftly to get to the bottom of what had happened, recognise the terrible mistake being made, save New Zealand many thousands of dollars and end a nightmare which was likely to end with the family being returned with nothing to live on the violent streets of South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I have already written to express my appreciation and thanks for the help on this case: a big win for New Zealand.

(17, 'Just a little more time please', 'Stepping in to offer help to a family from South Africa facing deportation after an immigration glitch through no fault of their own. Could we convince the immigration department to let these great people stay? Or would they face being turned out onto the street and eventually deported, shattering their New Zealand dreams and years of hard work.', '&lt;p&gt;On 12th May this year I noticed the headline &amp;#8216;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/6908484/Family-lives-in-fear-of-deportation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Family lives in fear of deportation&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216; and read about Cherie Vermaak and her children facing deportation from New Zealand. I immediately offered my help and have recently had news, but as background hereis where is all started:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A South African family that has been &amp;#8220;fighting an immigration battle for the past five years&amp;#8221; is now unlawfully living in Christchurch and says imminent deportation is more frightening than sleeping on the streets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The article went on to say that:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;She could not afford to pay rent next week and had been slowly selling &amp;#8220;everything I own&amp;#8221; to feed her two teenage children, Kyle, 19 and Zelda, 16.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Despite &amp;#8220;pleading&amp;#8221; for help from agencies, the family was not eligible for Government support because they did not have residency, nor could they temporarily sleep in their car because that had also been sold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This was someone who clearly needed help &amp;#8211; we met for the first time on May 16th and, as soon as Tammy and I found out the circumstances of the case, we offered our help.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&amp;#8217;d like to thank The Press for running the story on Cherie&amp;#8217;s situation, without this we would never had known anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making a difference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nOver the past 7 years as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.move2nz.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;move2nz&lt;/a&gt;,&nbsp;Tammy and I have been able to give help in supporting people &amp;#8211; for example our recent work with &lt;a href=&quot;http://move2nz.wordpress.com/tag/charmain-timmons/&quot;&gt;Charmain Timmons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our focus is on fairness and transparency in immigration. No matter how good information you give out is sometimes people fall between the cracks and end up in terrible situations. Rather than standing around &amp;#8216;tut-tutting&amp;#8217; we take action to make a positive difference.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immigration help&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nNow as a licensed immigration adviser it was great to be able to offer Cherie direct help with her immigration problems, something we previously had to rely on others for with varying degrees of success. I was pretty disgusted to find that she had been working with an adviser since she arrived in NZ, but they had walked away when the family ran out of money.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.move2nz.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;move2nz&lt;/a&gt; (offering family support) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newzealandimmigration.org.nz&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New Zealand Immigration &amp;amp; Settlement Services&lt;/a&gt; (providing immigration advice on a pro-bono basis) swung into action.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The first step was looking after the family: the Press ran a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/6979410/South-African-family-offered-help&quot;&gt;brilliant story&lt;/a&gt; and offers of help flooded in. Kiwis are amazingly generous when they realise a hard-working mum just needs a fair-go and this help made a huge difference.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With immediate fears of being turned onto the street taken care of we contacted the Ministry of Education to get Zelda back into school.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sorting out the immigration situation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nI collected a foot-high pile of papers and spent hours working out what had happened. It was great to be able to help with this and I soon worked out the problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Over the years working for the council Cherie had only ever been offered a 12 month contract. Because of this she could only get a 12 month visa and never move to the safety of residence. She was in the process of applying for yet another Work Visa when she was&nbsp;offered a permanent contract after helping through the devastation of the Canterbury earthquakes. Finally she could apply for residency and be safe.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately there was one problem: her police clearance certificate from South Africa didn&amp;#8217;t turn up in time. Her application to renew her Work Visa was declined so she lost her job &amp;#8211; no visa = no work = no money.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As we&amp;#8217;ve been saying on move2nz for years, migrants on temporary visas are vulnerable and this case proved that very well. Over time the family&amp;#8217;s savings got used up and they sold off all of their possessions. As temporary migrants they were not entitled to any benefit or government help meaning eventually they would become destitute and have to be deported unless Cherie could get another visa.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You&amp;#8217;ve got six weeks&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;/strong&gt;I spoke to Cherie&amp;#8217;s immigration case-officer to explain the situation, wrote a couple of letters and explained just how useful Cherie as a skilled worker was. After some good discussion the answer back from INZ: Cherie had six weeks for Cherie to find a skilled job that matched her qualifications and experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This was a very slim chance for the family knowing how long it can take to get a job offer and we needed to move fast. I re-wrote Cherie&amp;#8217;s already good CV and she worked night and day contacting employers about potential jobs. Meanwhile the media continued to run stories (see below).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The six weeks went very quickly and most of the employers Cherie had applied to were only just finishing advertising, meaning they wouldn&amp;#8217;t interview for days or weeks. Things started to look pretty serious for the family as their deadline to get out of New Zealand loomed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the next&nbsp;installment of this story&nbsp;I&amp;#8217;ll tell you what happened next ;o).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;News stories:&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;29/06/12 -&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/7193277/S-African-familys-deportation-looms&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;S African family&amp;#8217;s deportation looms&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;18/06/12 &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.3news.co.nz/Immigrants-get-help-adapting-to-Christchurch/tabid/423/articleID/258170/Default.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Immigrants get help adapting to Christchurch&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;(video);&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;15/06/12 &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/7109518/Two-weeks-till-deportation-for-S-African-family&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Two weeks till deportation for S African family&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;12/05/12 &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/6968240/Hard-wait-for-South-African-family-in-limbo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hard wait for South African family in &amp;#8216;limbo&amp;#8217;&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;24/05/12 &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/6979410/South-African-family-offered-help&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;South African family offered help&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;23/05/12 &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.3news.co.nz/South-African-family-gets-last-chance-for-immigration/tabid/309/articleID/255321/Default.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;South African family gets last chance for immigration&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;(video);&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;12/05/12 &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/6908484/Family-lives-in-fear-of-deportation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Family lives in fear of deportation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/move2nz.wordpress.com/568/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/move2nz.wordpress.com/568/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=move2nz.wordpress.com&amp;#038;blog=12518114&amp;#038;post=568&amp;#038;subd=move2nz&amp;#038;ref=&amp;#038;feed=1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;', 'move2nz', '2012-10-06 22:54:50', 'http://move2nz.wordpress.com/2012/07/11/just-a-little-more-time-please/', '2012-10-06 22:54:50', NULL, NULL, '0'),

Many people migrate because of a problem and sadly some bring that problem with them as Charmain did, her secret was that her husband was abusing her. Sadly this continued in their new life, but Charmain somehow found the strength to break free.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What devastated this family and lead to two years of fear and suffering was that despite being granted Residency in principle in February 2009, just a passport stamp from full residency, their application was cancelled because Charmain&amp;#8217;s&nbsp;husband broke the law ending up in jail.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What made this situation utterly unfair was that the crimes he committed were against Charmain and as a result she and their children were told to leave New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Charmain asked again for help in all the right places, but was poorly advised leading inevitably to being threatened with deportation which would have forced the family&nbsp;to leave everything they owned and their dreams of the future in New Zealand. Charmain&amp;#8217;s final hope was an appeal to Kate Wilkinson, the Associate Minister for Immigration, who alone had the power to save them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Fighting Charmain&amp;#8217;s corner&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As soon as we heard about this situation we decided we had to do something &amp;#8211; move2nz works to support migrants in New Zealand (like our work helping Martyn Payne and of course the &amp;#8216;Smith&amp;#8217; family who lived in our home for 6 months while they sorted out their immigration problems).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In August 2011 we launched a facebook campaign and online petition to urge the Associate Minister to look at Charmain&amp;#8217;s appeal and grant them residency. Over 1,200 people have since signed that petition and over a thousand used our page to send the petition message to the Prime Minister and Kate Wilkinson.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Unable to represent Charmain due to legal constraints move2nz worked to keep her spirits up with emotional support through what has been a terrible year during which Charmain fought constantly against her ex-husband&amp;#8217;s attempts to take the children and a system which appeared intent on punishing the victim of violence while supporting the abuser.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Happily we were also able to contact some very special people (you know who you are) who were able help directly and have been working for months, albeit behind the scenes, to obtain a positive outcome.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Fantastic news&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now ten months on Charmain has received the reply from Kate Wilkinson the Associate Minister she has been waiting for. This letter confirms that:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;quoteDiv&quot;&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;big&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I have decided to instruct Immigration New Zealand (INZ) to cancel the deportation orders in force against Ms Leighton and her two children, in accordance with section 177 of the Immigration Act 2009. I am also authorising INZ to grant a work visa to Ms Leighton and student visas to her two children under section 61 of the Immigration Act 2009 (s61), subject to health and&nbsp;character requirements being met.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;big&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is fantastic news as the weight has been lifted off the family. With emotions&nbsp;so tightly wound you can imagine the reaction this letter created.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The family are not out of the woods yet as they have to apply for this visa and, without residency, are still in a temporary and potentially vulnerable position. However they now they have all they were ever asking for thanks to Kate Wilkinson and the many people who have worked on their behalf: a chance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;A message from Charmain&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Once Charmain got over the shock of this announcement she sent through a message for the many people who have helped her:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;quoteDiv&quot;&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;big&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Kia Ora to all of our supporters globally and here in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The children and I received long awaited news that we are allowed to stay here in New Zealand, this country that is now our home. I am allowed to continue with my Bachelor of Social Work degree and be able to work. My children now have student visa&rsquo;s and we as a family can work to residency.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Your continuing support has kept us strong and motivated. A lot of tears have been shed through this journey but sitting down and reading your thoughts have been truly comforting. I would like to say a heartfelt thank you to everyone who has been supporting my family but more importantly were supporting two innocent little children and I as their mother&nbsp;were their only voice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you again and my gratitude I cannot put into words.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;big&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I would also like to thank everyone who helped through this difficult time. This is a great result and gives hope that when a mistake is being made the Associate Minister can and may step in to save a miscarriage of natural justice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whohoo!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;move2nz is continuing to work to support and assist migrants suffering injustice.

I will&nbsp;let you know if I get a reply.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here are some points to consider that will affect a great many people and a look at what is being gained through these changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;When will existing applications be processed?&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What the immigration website indicated was that new applications under Tier One of the Parent Category would go straight to the&nbsp;front of the queue for allocation and processing. Applications for the Parent Sibling&nbsp;and Adult Child Stream would be added to the queue behind these and last of all would come the new Tier Two Parent application.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tier One applications entered under the new Parent rules;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Existing applications entered under the old rules (both &amp;#8216;Parent&amp;#8217; and Sibling/AdultChild&amp;#8217;);&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tier Two applications entered under the new Parent rules.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are 4,000 places in the annual quota &amp;#8211; that&amp;#8217;s&nbsp;4,000 &lt;strong&gt;people&lt;/strong&gt; not 4,000 applications (family category applications&nbsp;on average represent 1.93 people). What the INZ site appears to say is that the quota will initially be filled each year from Tier One, then any additional places will be allocated to the older applications and finally any places left will go to Tier Two.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is that the old Parent Category with a quota of 4,000 was always over-subscribed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;More than 4,000 places have been approved already this year and the new rules for Tier One are unlikely to reduce this number.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So after 4,000 places have been taken by Tier One applications each year what happens to the older applications and Tier Two?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is the main issue raised in my letter and I am deeply concerned that it will be years, possibly even decades, before these applications are finally allocated for processing unless the old quota of 1,400 places for the Sibling and Adult Child Category is left in place until these are cleared.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of course a lot depends on how many people will be sitting in that queue behind Tier One waiting to be allocated a case-officer. So just how many are there and how long would it take to clear this backlog?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Just how big is the queue?&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Immigration department statistics are a little out of date, only showing to January&nbsp;2012 but more recent figures are shown each fortnight on the release showing numbers&nbsp;of Expressions of Interest selected under the Skilled Migrant Category.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At the bottom of the page this confirms that on May 16th the INZ had &lt;a class=&quot;boldLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.immigration.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/92FBAE3E-D2D8-438C-8071-42CF2500910C/0/FactSheet20120516.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;6,406&lt;/a&gt; applications entered under what is now the old Parent Sibling and Adult Child Category representing 12,348 people.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;News stories have confirmed that the INZ accepted &lt;a class=&quot;boldLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.nzherald.co.nz/employment/news/article.cfm?c_id=11&amp;amp;objectid=10807494&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;7,400&lt;/a&gt; applications before closing this Category which would represent approximately another 14,264 people giving a grand total of around 26,612 people standing in the queue to be allocated a case-officer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Even if the old quota for the Sibling and Adult Child section of the category of&nbsp;1,400 was maintained (and the immigration department have indicated this will not be the case) I calculate that it would take 19 years to clear this number,&nbsp;a completely unacceptable length of time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Just what the Minister proposes to do to meet promises made of less than two years before applicants are allocated a case-officer will hopefully be revealed soon. I have great faith that the Minister will uphold the integrity of his department and not leave people waiting for decades to be allocated a case-officer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;What will be gained from these changes?&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I may be speculating here, but for the first time in recent history the INZ is carrying&nbsp;a significant deficit, calculated to be as much as &lt;a class=&quot;boldLink&quot; href=&quot;http://img.scoop.co.nz/media/pdfs/1203/Govt_First_100_Days__Immigration.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$44 million&lt;/a&gt; by the end of June.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As the INZ&amp;#8217;s processing work is funded through fees paid by migrants it is little wonder that the department has a deficit after the Skilled Migrant Category, making up 60 percent of all approvals, was cut by nearly a third from January 2010 &amp;#8211; a move I calculate loses the INZ $16.7 million per year in fees and levies (not including EOI payments).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The NZ government has confirmed many times that there is no new money in this year&amp;#8217;s&nbsp;Budget to be delivered soon meaning that this massive deficit (which represents&nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;boldLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.dol.govt.nz/publications/general/ar1011/annualreport1011.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nearly a quarter&lt;/a&gt; of the INZ&amp;#8217;s entire budget for processing) can only be cleared either through raising the number of migrants paying fees back up to 2009 levels, or through &amp;#8216;efficiencies&amp;#8217; that would see migrants paying more than the cost of processing their applications. It is interesting that a new EOI stage and fee have now been added for parents.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Certainly closing an immigration category bringing just 1,400 people who could not&nbsp;claim benefits into New Zealand each year is exceedingly unlikely to save the &lt;a class=&quot;boldLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/changes-immigration-family-policies-confirmed&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$40 million&lt;/a&gt; expected and needed to clear this huge shortfall created as a result of policy changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of course letting in an additional 7,400 applications, many of which will be incomplete, will create additional delays and backlogs adding more and more pressure to INZ staff who are likely to be squeezed pretty hard to clear this massive backlog of applications.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Please bear in mind when you are talking to immigration officers that this situation has been created as a result of policy changes completely outside their control. They will be doing a very hard job while watching a new computer system being built which will be likely to replace at least some members of staff, so please take it easy on them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;A backwards step&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Finally as a parting thought, although I have no issue with the government&amp;#8217;s right to change immigration policy it is hard to regard these changes as a positive step.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Government press releases have confirmed a long term goal to &amp;#8220;&lt;a class=&quot;boldLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/changes-immigration-family-policies-confirmed&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;attract and retain skilled migrants&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; however policies introduced appear to working counter to this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Attraction of skilled migrants has suffered a huge knock with huge cuts to the Skilled Migrant residence Category and the Essential Skills temporary work category implemented intentionally since the start of 2010. These latest changes are likely to threaten retention rates through removing family support.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Although the family members targeted by these changes do not necessarily generate significant income for the New Zealand economy it is clear that they are not a drain on it. Less than 2 percent of migrants claim core benefits in New Zealand, any amounts collected by family migrants would be claimed back by government from their sponsor,&nbsp;and employment rates put forward as a reason to close this category show that workplace&nbsp;participation just amongst these family members (i.e. excluding the skilled workers) of 66 percent compares well the New Zealand average of &lt;a class=&quot;boldLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.dol.govt.nz/publications/lmr/participation/summary/index.asp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;68.2 percent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In my experience of working with thousands of migrants a core issue reducing retention&nbsp;of highly skilled workers is lack of family support at key life stages. For example&nbsp;when a child is born or gets sick new mothers often look for the support of &lt;em&gt;their&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;mother to get through and many have to leave New Zealand to get this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As any family with children will know, the wider family around you makes an incredible difference. I&amp;#8217;m not just talking about baby-sitting, but it touches everything through general support and the feeling of safety and well-being created from having people who love you and will watch out for you and yours.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Most migrants leaving speak of a feeling of vulnerability which has grown to unmanageable proportions being so far from people who love them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Many New Zealanders will understand this very well &amp;#8211; one of the most common times for New Zealanders to head home is when they start a family and realise home is where the heart is. It&amp;#8217;s not just about a place, it&amp;#8217;s about having the security of your family around you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I believe this change to block certain parents and any other family unable&nbsp;to make it through the Skilled Migrant Category &amp;#8211; so stringent that it is open only&nbsp;to approximately 2 percent of any population &amp;#8211; will most certainly decrease retention rates of skilled workers who are the main contributors to the $1.9 billion to $3 billion (net of costs) added to the New Zealand economy by migrants every year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Mike Bell&lt;br /&gt;\nSite architect, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.move2nz.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;move2nz.com&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;- helping migrants become kiwis since 2005&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/move2nz.wordpress.com/521/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/move2nz.wordpress.com/521/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=move2nz.wordpress.com&amp;#038;blog=12518114&amp;#038;post=521&amp;#038;subd=move2nz&amp;#038;ref=&amp;#038;feed=1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;', 'move2nz', '2012-10-06 22:54:50', 'http://move2nz.wordpress.com/2012/05/26/move2nz-investigates-family-category-changes/', '2012-10-06 22:54:50', NULL, NULL, '0'),

This interview has gained importance as Mr Guy has since confirmed that this conversation was the official launch of new government policy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;During the interview the Minister confirmed&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;&hellip;. those [immigrants] that have been coming in previously have been very reliant on benefits.

Data was collected at 6 months, 18 months and 36 months after arrival.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;However the LISNZ confirms in its summarised May 2009 report entitled &lsquo;New Faces, New Futures, New Zealand&rsquo; that:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;less than 2% [of migrants surveyed] had received a core benefit&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Responding to a request lodged by Bell under the OIA about his comments on &amp;#8220;migrants claiming benefits, Mr Guy responded:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;only 66% of migrants who obtained residence through the Sibling and Adult Child Category reported having a job when surveyed 18 months after taking up permanent residence in New Zealand.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bell says she was deeply surprised by this revelation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;How can the Minister confuse &amp;#8216;not being in paid work&amp;#8217; with &amp;#8216;claiming a benefit&amp;#8217;? I can&amp;#8217;t imagine what more an Immigration Minister could have done to damage New Zealand&amp;#8217;s international reputation as a migrant destination&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Sibling and Adult Child Category accounted for just 2.5% of residence applications approved in the year to October 2005, however the Minister&rsquo;s televised statement appeared to relate to all migrants coming to New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Even if a third of this small group wasn&amp;#8217;t in full time work, where is the cost to the taxpayer?&amp;#8221; Bell asks. &amp;#8220;Migrants can&amp;#8217;t claim benefits in the first two years after receiving residency and even if they did their family sponsor would be liable to pay every cent back to the government&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Official forms signed by the sponsors of family migrants applying to come to New Zealand include a declaration that they promise to provide financial support and an acknowledgement that any costs to the government will be repaid by the sponsor or they will face enforcement and court action&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The LISNZ survey confirms that of these family members not in full-time work 14% were retired, 33% were caring for dependents, and 29% were studying.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While the Minister has focussed on employment data collected 18 months into the LISNZ survey, final reports confirm that nearly 10% more of the family group were employed by the end of the study, than at the beginning. The majority of family members not in work were found to be studying or looking after dependents, not &lsquo;requiring benefits&rsquo; as the Minister has claimed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On May 16th, in a move presented to save government $40 million per year, Nathan Guy closed the Sibling and Adult Child categories on the basis that they did not generate &amp;#8220;sufficient economic benefit for New Zealand&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This move has drawn criticism and court action from migrant groups angry that changes were introduced with just three days&rsquo; notice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;According to Bell, these family members are vital to the successful settlement of high value migrants being actively attracted to New Zealand by the immigration department.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The family category added security, supporting highly skilled workers and entrepreneurs employing Kiwis, helping them continue to add to our economy&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Department of Labour reports have previously confirmed that 24% of migrants intending to stay permanently leave with a major cause being lack of family support.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The immigration department is funded from migrant fees. Immigration policies introduced in January 2010 effectively cut the number of skilled workers by nearly a third, leading to a record deficit for the department calculated to reach $44 million by June this year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Guy has admitted that migrant families will be split apart by the changes he has introduced which will enable his department to recoup losses caused by the decision to significantly reduce immigration numbers, however the Minister has not offered any explanation of why his television comments were incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Summary points:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&nbsp;The Minister stated that a third of migrants claim benefits within 18 months.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Less than 2% of migrants from the study actually received benefits.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Migrants not in work were confirmed to be retired, caring for dependents or studying.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The Minister has used this as a reason to close the Sibling and Adult Child categories.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experts claim this will reduce New Zealand&amp;#8217;s appeal for high value migrants.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Immigration adds between $1.9 billion and $3 billion net of costs to New Zealand&amp;#8217;s economy each year.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcript of Breakfast TV interview with Nathan Guy, 6/3/12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Petra Bagust: You&amp;#8217;re with Breakfast, the time is 6:56. Ah we&amp;#8217;re going to talk about immigration now, are wealthy &nbsp;immigrants more welcome in New Zealand. If we take the government&amp;#8217;s plans at face value it appears the answer is &amp;#8216;yes&amp;#8217;. Immigration changes will be aimed at reducing the number of unskilled migrants who struggle to get jobs and end up on the benefit. But are they fair? Immigration Minister Nathan Guy joins me now. Good Morning Mr. Guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Nathan Guy: Morning Petra, how are you?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Petra Bagust: Well thank you. Why do these changes need to be made?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Nathan Guy: Well what we have found Petra is that those that have been coming in previously have been very reliant on benefits. Even though they have had to have a job offer in a lot of cases we have found that after a study we have done on the first 18 months that a third of them have ended up requiring a benefit. We want to refocus this to ensure that those that are coming in have a decent income stream with them or via their sponsor and that they can perform in our modern day economy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Petra Bagust: Alright. As it has been suggested does it in essence create an immigration system that favours the wealthy?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Nathan Guy: Well, we make no bones about that. We want to ensure that those that are coming in to our economy can hold down a job and ensure that they perform in our economy. Hard working taxpayers in New Zealand need to know that their money is being well invested, not spent on people sitting around on benefits, and you will know that the government is talking about big welfare reform plans this year, and these changes very much line up with those.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Petra: Alright. We want to talk about high income workers. What is the definition of &amp;#8216;high income&amp;#8217; here?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Nathan Guy: Well we&amp;#8217;re working through what those definitions will mean and I&amp;#8217;ll announce those in due course. In essence the changes are that parents will still be able to come in, but they will need to have some financial dependence when they arrive and that will be savings that they will bring in, or indeed they&amp;#8217;ll have cash-flow from their sponsor. And those adult children and siblings category, that will change and they will be required to apply through the Skilled Migrant Category.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Petra Bagust: So the balance I guess is between saving money, there is an estimated $40 million dollars going to be saved, and also the success of people immigrating to New Zealand and settling here. I guess some families will be split apart because of this new legislation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Nathan Guy: That may happen, but of course they still have the option of replying through the Skilled Migrant Category. Parents still have the option of coming in to New Zealand if they have a sponsor and if they have that financial backing that I talked about before. So I make no apologies, this government is focused on driving the economy forward. Where possible we want migrants coming that are going to perform in our modern day economy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Petra Bagust: Nathan Guy, Immigration Minister, thanks for joining us this morning.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Nathan Guy: Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Corin Dann: Look I&amp;#8217;ve got no doubt the government is trying to tweak things here to make the system a bit better, but what I don&amp;#8217;t like is this perception that somehow migrants are coming in here and sitting around and going on benefits. I&amp;#8217;m sure there are some instances, but let&amp;#8217;s face it, who drives your cabs? Who serves you at the supermarket counter? I don&amp;#8217;t know about you but most of the immigrants that I come across are working in tough jobs, doing the jobs that a lot of kiwis don&amp;#8217;t want to do frankly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Petra Bagust: It is an interesting little can of worms and we&amp;#8217;re talk about again to get back to us again if you have got feedback about this issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/move2nz.wordpress.com/509/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/move2nz.wordpress.com/509/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=move2nz.wordpress.com&amp;#038;blog=12518114&amp;#038;post=509&amp;#038;subd=move2nz&amp;#038;ref=&amp;#038;feed=1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;', 'move2nz', '2012-10-06 22:54:50', 'http://move2nz.wordpress.com/2012/05/22/ministers-competence-called-in-to-question/', '2012-10-06 22:54:50', NULL, NULL, '0');

(22, 'NZ Residency &amp;ndash; changes to the Family Stream', 'Important changes to the Parent and Sibling/Adult Child categories of New Zealand''s Residency Programme will come into almost immediate effect. This article covers the details of these changes and asks the questions about what will happen to those who have already lodged their application as it appears these will no longer be honoured!', '&lt;p&gt;As highlighted on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.move2nz.com&quot;&gt;move2nz.com&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;earlier in the year, the report prepared for the incoming Immigration Minister Nathan Guy confirmed plans to make significant changes to the Capped Family Stream of New Zealands Residence Programme.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I will comment about the lack of honesty in the Minister&amp;#8217;s reasoning presented for these changes separately as that deserves its own space.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here I present a summary of the changes announced this week to the Capped Family Stream of New Zealand&amp;#8217;s Residence Programme.&nbsp;These changes to both the Parent and Sibling and Adult &nbsp;Child categories are significant and come into effect almost immediately (May 16th 2012).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep Concerns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;At first reading I am extremely concerned about how these changes will affect those who have already paid the NZ government $780 to lodge their applications.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It appears that applications on hand, especially those in the Sibling and Adult Child category, have been relegated to a point in the queue which can never be reached because categories in front of them will be constantly replenished (and over-subscribed) meaning these applications may never be processed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If this is the case I shall be investigating the legal position on this &amp;#8211; taking money for services which will never be provide (even services which will be provided in &amp;#8216;several years&amp;#8217;) is likely to be &nbsp;a serious breach of contract and deeply unfair.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Parent Category&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Closure&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Parent Category will close from May 16th 2012 until July 2012 (date yet to be decided) at which time the new rules will be in place. The new rules will implement a fresh two-tier system with the same quota for parents of around 4,000 places per year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Requirements on health and character will not change but an English language requirement&nbsp;has been added and the &amp;#8216;centre of gravity&amp;#8217; rules changed. Parents will not be able&nbsp;to have any dependent children.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A two-tier system&nbsp;The Parent Category is currently run on a two-tier system splitting the quota between the fast tracked Parent Retirement Category (which includes a requirement for $1.5 million in settlement and investment funds) and everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Parent Retirement Category will remain relatively unchanged, but changes implemented&nbsp;from May 16th create a new two-tier system within the other Parent Category:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tier 1 requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;have a guaranteed lifetime minimum income of NZ$27,203 per annum&nbsp;for a single person or $NZ39,890 per annum for a couple, or&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;bring at least NZ$500,000 in settlement funds to New Zealand, or&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;have a sponsoring adult child who has an annual income of at least NZ$65,000, or joint income of NZ$90,000 when combined with their partner&rsquo;s income.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tier One applicants will not be subject to a &ldquo;centre of gravity&rdquo; test whereby the number of adult children in New Zealand need to be at least as many as the adult children in the home country.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;spacedLI&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tier 2 requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;spacedLI&quot;&gt;Tier two applicants must have a sponsoring adult child who hasan income of at least NZ$33,675 per annum, and&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;spacedLI&quot;&gt;Any other children the applicant has must live outside the countryin which the applicant lives.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;The effect of changes&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For most parents this change to the Parent Category will cause very little difference.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Parent Category already plays second fiddle to the Parent Retirement Category&nbsp;(for parents with $1.5 million in their pockets) which has first bite at places in the quota). In my experience almost all parents will have a pension, settlement funds, or children earning a reasonable salary.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The main change is for the sponsor as they will now be responsible for covering&nbsp;any costs to government of their parents for ten years instead of five.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t imagine this will make much difference to government costs as in the last census migrants (as in all migrants including parents) were shown to contribute&nbsp;over $3,000 to the economy each per year. Rather than acting as a drain migrants&nbsp;actually add wealth.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;An extra tax on migrants&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One of the changes made to the Parent Category that will create a difference is&nbsp;the introduction of an Expression of Interest costing $420 to be made prior to any application. The reasons for this are officially given as:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;quoteDiv&quot;&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extra NZ$420 fee for Parent Category EOIs pays for the work INZ undertakes in&nbsp;processing them. This work is separate from the work done in processing Parent Category&nbsp;applications, so INZ needs to charge a separate fee for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul class=&quot;arrowList&quot;&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;boldLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.immigration.govt.nz/migrant/general/generalinformation/qanda/parentchanges.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is not correct.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The immigration department&amp;#8217;s costs of processing applications are met by fees collected&nbsp;from migrants. Until recently the amount being paid by migrants always met the costs&nbsp;of the INZ meaning that the amount being charged to migrants was about right.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;However from January 2010 policies were introduced by the then Immigration Minister&nbsp;Jonathan Coleman which intentionally cut the department&amp;#8217;s income through reducing&nbsp;the number of applications accepted through the Skilled Migrant Category by nearly&nbsp;a third.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The effect of this change was naturally a deficit calculated by the department to&nbsp;be likely to reach $44 million by the end of June.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I was wondering how the department was going to recoup this massive sum, nearly&nbsp;a quarter of their annual budget, and here is part of their answer: an EOI system which is&nbsp;effectively a new tax on migrants.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;A long wait for Tier-2&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in my article on the changes to the &lt;a class=&quot;boldLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.move2nz.com/member/showArticle.aspx?id=829&amp;amp;sm=g1000p1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sibling/Adult child category&lt;/a&gt; the quota&nbsp;for the sibling and adult child component of the Capped Family stream is being stripped&nbsp;away. Applications already entered will be processed in date order if there are&nbsp;any spaces left after Tier-1 of the Parent Category has been filled.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This means a wait of potentially several years for the over 6,000 sibling and adult&nbsp;child applications currently held by the immigration department.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The wait for Tier-2 of the Parent category is likely to be even longer as these&nbsp;will be added to the back of this existing queue which will be processed in date&nbsp;order.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a result it is likely &nbsp;that any Tier-2 application entered after July 2012&nbsp;when this stream reopens will wait at least several years to be allocated a case-officer&nbsp;to process what are generally fairly simple cases for healthy applicants who can&nbsp;demonstrate their relationship to their sponsor.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul class=&quot;arrowList&quot;&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;boldLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.immigration.govt.nz/migrant/general/generalinformation/qanda/parentchanges.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Detailed questions on the Parent Category&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;boldLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.immigration.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/8E89DA13-32CD-4596-8CA7-0D010E5A7DB3/0/FactsheetParent.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Government Factsheet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;boldLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.immigration.govt.nz/migrant/general/generalinformation/news/familycategorychanges.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Family Category changes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;boldLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.move2nz.com/member/showArticle.aspx?id=829&amp;amp;sm=g1000p1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;move2nz article on the Sibling and Adult Child Category&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Sibling/Adult Child Category&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Closure&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This category will be closed from May 16th and no applications will be accepted after the 15th.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;What happens to existing applications?&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The INZ have confirmed that applications entered before 16th May will be processed, unfortunately it looks like this is going to take longer than expected. A lot longer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For the past couple of years applications have sat gathering dust for an average of 2 years before a case-officer was allocated and processing could begin. This was causing some problems for applicants because during that time while they needed a job offer which would stay open for them they had no right to be in New Zealand unless they could get some other temporary visa to allow them to work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That &amp;#8216;two years&amp;#8217; just turned into &amp;#8216;several years&amp;#8217; because of the changes&nbsp;announced today.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The new Parent Category will have a quota of approximately 4,000 people per year, a drop from the old Capped Family Category quota of between 4,950 and 5,500 per year as only the parent quota remains.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That quota will be initially filled with Tier-1 Parent Category applications. If the quota is not filled then other applications will be collected to meet the difference:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;quoteDiv&quot;&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Existing Sibling and Adult Child applications will be processed with other Parent Category applications &lt;strong&gt;in date order&lt;/strong&gt;, only after tier one Parent Category EOIs and if numbers allow.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul class=&quot;arrowList&quot;&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;boldLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.immigration.govt.nz/migrant/general/generalinformation/qanda/sibadchildchanges.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;A long wait&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The number of applicants with the immigration department for what is now the old Capped Family Stream (parent, sibling and adult child) has been steadily rising despite the best efforts of the department for years because numbers being entered were higher than the quota.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The most recent immigration department figures available (January 2012) show&nbsp;6,028 applications on hand for this stream.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;How long it will take to clear this backlog is anyone&amp;#8217;s guess, but it is likely that it could take a very long time indeed. Requirements for Tier-1 of the new Parent Category are likely to be met by the parents of skilled migrants who have sold a home to come to New Zealand or draw an overseas pension meaning that it is possible that the quota of 4,000 people (i.e. 2,000 couples) will be filled every year leaving no space for these older applications. Certainly in recent years this quota has been oversubscribed by parents.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The result of taking away the quota for siblings and adult children, squeezing this in to any gap left in the parent category, will be that thousands of people who have entered applications&nbsp;in good faith will now have to wait considerably longer for their applications to be processed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Many will be forced to give up their plans of living in New Zealand if they cannot use the Skilled Migrant Category&nbsp;or face living in limbo for what is likely to be several years.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For parents falling into the new Tier-2 stream the situation appears to be even worse. Their applcations will be added to the 6,028 and processed in date order. Any new applicants will know that they have at least 6,000 other people standing in front of them in the line and are unlikely to reach the head of that queue in their lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Why government could not have continued processing applications in the same way without accepting any more I don&amp;#8217;t know, but I suspect that it has something to do with the immigration department&amp;#8217;s deficit and a need to reduce operating costs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As that deficit was created intentionally as a result of policies introduced by the last Minister this knock-on effect is particularly unfair and may well cause many skilled migrants to change their plans about moving to New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul class=&quot;arrowList&quot;&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;boldLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.immigration.govt.nz/migrant/general/generalinformation/qanda/sibadchildchanges.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Detailed questions on the Sibling and Adult Child Category&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;boldLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.immigration.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/8E89DA13-32CD-4596-8CA7-0D010E5A7DB3/0/FactsheetParent.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Government Factsheet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;boldLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.immigration.govt.nz/migrant/general/generalinformation/news/familycategorychanges.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Family Category changes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;boldLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.move2nz.com/member/showArticle.aspx?id=830&amp;amp;sm=g1000p1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;move2nz article on Parent Category changes announced&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Discussions on these changes can be posted here or on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.move2nz.com&quot;&gt;move2nz.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Mike&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.move2nz.com&quot;&gt;move2nz.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/move2nz.wordpress.com/502/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/move2nz.wordpress.com/502/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=move2nz.wordpress.com&amp;#038;blog=12518114&amp;#038;post=502&amp;#038;subd=move2nz&amp;#038;ref=&amp;#038;feed=1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;', 'move2nz', '2012-10-06 22:54:50', 'http://move2nz.wordpress.com/2012/05/12/nz-residency-changes-to-the-family-stream/', '2012-10-06 22:54:50', NULL, NULL, '0'),
(23, 'Building transparency on EOI selections for skilled migrants', 'The chances of success for many Expressions of Interest entered by skilled workers into the immigration system for residency have declined by as much as a third, yet few people are aware of this. The facts may surprise you.', '&lt;p&gt;As regular readers of my newsletters and blogs (and anyone researching a permanent move) will know, the Skilled Migrant Category (SMC &amp;#8211; you&amp;#8217;ll get used to all of the acronyms!) of New Zealand&amp;#8217;s Residence Programme starts with an Expression of Interest or EOI.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This EOI contains all of the information needed to make a decision about your application&nbsp;and costs &lt;a class=&quot;boldLink&quot; title=&quot;PDF document&quot; href=&quot;http://www.immigration.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/00B58004-04AB-46C6-B32B-5CE91FBA979A/0/INZ1028July2011.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$440&lt;/a&gt; (if you submit it online, $560 if you send in a paper form). EOIs submitted go in to a &amp;#8216;pool&amp;#8217; and each fortnight the immigration department selects a number of EOIs from the pool to meet agreed quotas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The SMC is run on a points system (see a description of this category &lt;a class=&quot;boldLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.immigration.govt.nz/migrant/stream/work/skilledmigrant/overview/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and details of bonus points &lt;a class=&quot;boldLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.immigration.govt.nz/opsmanual/6954.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) and EOIs need to score more than 100 points to be entered.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I have been &lt;a class=&quot;boldLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.move2nz.com/member/showArticle.aspx?id=695&amp;amp;sm=g1000p1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;concerned for some time&lt;/a&gt; that there is not&nbsp;enough clarity around the chances of EOIs being submitted being pulled from the pool before they expire and the applicants lose their money. Although there are no guarantees I believe that migrants have a right to transparency so that they can weigh up the decision before paying to enter an EOI.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here is what the immigration department&amp;#8217;s website says about EOI selections:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;quoteDiv&quot;&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expressions of Interest that have total points of 140 or more are selected automatically&nbsp;Expressions of Interest that have less than 140 points and include points for jobs&nbsp;or job offers are selected in sufficient numbers to meet the requirements of the&nbsp;New Zealand Residence Programme Additional Expressions of Interest may be selected&nbsp;from the pool to meet the requirements of the New Zealand Residence Programme using&nbsp;criteria set by the Minister of Immigration.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul class=&quot;arrowList&quot;&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;boldLink&quot; href=&quot;http://formshelp.immigration.govt.nz/SkilledMigrant/ExpressionOfInterest/HistoryOfSelectionPoints.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What the statement above says to me is that:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;spacedLI&quot;&gt;EOIs entered with 140 points or more will be selected.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;spacedLI&quot;&gt;EOIs entered with less than 140 points and a job offer will beselected, but only within the quota.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;spacedLI&quot;&gt;EOIs entered with less than 140 points and no job may be selectedto meet requirements.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;spacedLI&quot;&gt;The NZ residence programme requirements will be met.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Is this what is actually happening?&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Well yes and no. To help me explain I will use groupings that were commonly used by the immigration department before 2009 (policy has not changed since then, it&amp;#8217;s just that some of these groups are no longer ever selected):&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;spacedLI&quot;&gt;140 points or more with a job offer;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;spacedLI&quot;&gt;140 points or more;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;spacedLI&quot;&gt;100 &amp;#8211; 135 points with a job offer;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;spacedLI&quot;&gt;100 points or more with 15 bonus points for work experience;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;spacedLI&quot;&gt;100 points or more with 10 bonus points for work experience;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;spacedLI&quot;&gt;100 points or more with 10 bonus points for qualifications;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;spacedLI&quot;&gt;100 points or more with no bonus points.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All of these groups are valid entries under the current system, but how do your chances stack up for each of these groups?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;2011/2012&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The immigration year starts on 1st July. To give you an idea of selection patterns here are the numbers which have been selected since July 2011 for groups above.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Group:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;spacedLI&quot;&gt;62% (6,308);&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;spacedLI&quot;&gt;13% (1,320);&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;spacedLI&quot;&gt;17% (1,730);&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;spacedLI&quot;&gt;8% (861);&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;spacedLI&quot;&gt;0% (0);&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;spacedLI&quot;&gt;0% (0);&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;spacedLI&quot;&gt;0% (0).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Groups 1 and 3 (those with job offers)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nThe emphasis in the Skilled Migrant Category is to bring in skilled workers who have either obtained job offers or are already working &amp;#8211; i.e. groups 1 and 3. As a result in the year to date these two groups make up 79% of all EOIs accepted.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Group 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nOn average the department try to select around 100 from Group 2 (which are high scoring applicants who do not yet have a job offer) each fortnight depending on what is available. Applicants entering Group&nbsp;2 EOIs have a pretty good chance of being selected before their EOI lapses &amp;#8211; on average so far in the year from July the department has selected 96 per fortnight so they are pretty much on target and could probably do with some more of these.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Group 4 (15 bonus points for work experience)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nEOIs submitted in this group are not always selected each fortnight and overall only a very small number of these EOIs have been picked. What may catch people out is that the pass mark (i.e. the minimum number of points needed before selection) wanders around. For example on 14 December 2011 EOIs claiming 110 points were selected, but in other weeks only those with 120, 130 or even 135 will be taken from the pool.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here is a graph of the pass-mark since July 2011 (applications with points below the red line would not be selected).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;Group 4 passmark in 2011/12&quot; src=&quot;http://www.move2nz.com/images/articles/817/group4_passmark.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Group 4 passmark in 2011/12&quot; width=&quot;475&quot; height=&quot;322&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What you can see from this is that no EOI entered falling into this group scoring less than 110 points has been selected so far this year. For most months EOIs would need to score&nbsp;125 points or better and the average &amp;#8216;pass-mark&amp;#8217; (of points needed to be selected through 2011/12) has been 128 so far.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a marked change from 2010/11 when EOIs scoring over 100 points were often selected. In fact for 2010/11 the average &amp;#8216;pass-mark&amp;#8217; needed for a reasonable chance of selection was only 108 points.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Group 5 (10 bonus points for work experience)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nNo EOIs have been selected falling&nbsp;into this group since 19 May 2011 when EOIs claiming just 100 points and upwards were selected. This means that all EOIs falling into this group entered between May 2011 and late September 2011 (so far) lapsed before being selected. Any EOIs being entered in this group are highly unlikely to be selected under the current&nbsp;regime.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Group 6 (10 bonus points for qualifications)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nAgain no EOIs have been selected falling into this group since 19 May 2011 have been selected meaning that many would have lapsed. Any EOIs being entered in this group are highly unlikely to be selected under the current regime.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Group 7 (no bonus points)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nNo EOIs in this group have been selected since December 2009 meaning that any EOI entered which did not exceed 140 points or claim bonus points between December 2009 and September 2011 would have lapsed. Any EOIs being entered in this group are highly unlikely to be selected under the current regime.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;New Zealand Residence Programme requirements&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An important&nbsp;point affecting migrant&amp;#8217;s expectations of their EOI being selected from the pool is the statement that the current regime will meet &amp;#8220;the requirements of the New Zealand Residence Programme&amp;#8221;. Many migrants entering EOIs may feel that this means the chances of their EOI being selected has not diminished, however this is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Skilled Migrant Category makes up around 58 percent of New Zealand&amp;#8217;s Residence programme which is spread across three main streams: Business/Skilled (90% of which is the SMC); family and humanitarian. The Residence programme has a quota agreed by government, which used to be between 45,000 and 50,000 per year&nbsp;and is now a span of between 135,000 and 150,000 over the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In 2010/11&nbsp;the immigration department failed to meet the Residence quota for the first time. The department did not miss this by a little, but by 4,263 or 9.5%. The majority of this shortfall came from the Skilled Migrant Category which was 3,855 or 14.3% short.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating a little transparency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nGovernment reports blame the Canterbury earthquakes and global recession, however when asked for the data to support these conclusions the authors are not able to provide this information. Interestingly the reports fail to attribute any blame for the fall in numbers gaining residency through the Skilled Migrant Category to policy changes made by the immigration Minister, for example the 30% cut implemented since January 2010 in the number of EOIs selected for processing through the SMC residency stream!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This year (although the quotas have been now spread over 3 years) the department is heading for a shortfall of 8,442 (based on departmental statistics to February 2012) or 33.8% on the Skilled Migrant Category.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Migrants entering EOIs should be aware that although technically the requirements of the Residence programme are being met, this is because the &amp;#8216;goalposts have been moved&amp;#8217;. In reality applicants entering an EOI stand a significantly lower chance of that EOI being selected for processing as not only has the number of EOIs being pulled from the pool been cut by 30%, the percentage of those lucky applications which are declined has doubled over recent years to 17.8% so far in 2011/12.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I am concerned that immigration&nbsp;department statements, like the one I quoted earlier in this article, give many migrants thinking of entering EOIs overblown expectations of their chances of being selected. While those with job offers or over 140 points can reasonably expect to be selected under the current regime, thousands of others are entering EOIs in good faith not realising they stand little or no chance of being selected.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Figures for the number of EOIs which have lapsed (i.e. dropped out of the pool with the fee lost) are not available, however if numbers from 2009 had been maintained through the months since over 2,200 applications entered &amp;#8211; which would have stood a good chance of being selected in previous years under what is presented as the same system &amp;#8211; would have lapsed meaning the applicants would have lost their money.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Not considering additional costs to migrants (such as paying a professional to help prepare the EOI), fees received by the New Zealand government alone for applications which had little or no chance of success would add up to nearly $900,000!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I would very much like to see the position clarified in immigration department information so that migrants are given transparent information on the current criteria (which has been in force since January 2010) enabling them to make informed choices on whether to submit their EOI or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this article will begin this process of building awareness and transparency.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Mike&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.move2nz.com&quot;&gt;move2nz.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/move2nz.wordpress.com/486/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/move2nz.wordpress.com/486/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=move2nz.wordpress.com&amp;#038;blog=12518114&amp;#038;post=486&amp;#038;subd=move2nz&amp;#038;ref=&amp;#038;feed=1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;', 'move2nz', '2012-10-06 22:54:50', 'http://move2nz.wordpress.com/2012/03/30/building-transparency-on-eoi-selections-for-skilled-migrants/', '2012-10-06 22:54:50', NULL, NULL, '0'),

Since then the number of perfectly acceptable EOIs left to expire has been steadily rising as only a third of the EOIs available are being selected.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These policy changes helped drop the New&nbsp;Zealand residence programme figures&nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;boldLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.dol.govt.nz/publications/research/migration-trends-1011/05.asp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;4,263&lt;/a&gt; below the minimum quota last year &amp;#8211; the first time the quota has been missed since it was introduced. This would have cost the department over $6.2 million in lost fees and levies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This process has continued and as a result the shortfall caused by policy is calculated to double in&nbsp;the current year with the Immigration department on target to miss the old residence programme quota by a whopping 33%.&nbsp;The drop of 8,442 migrants below quota will lose the government over $12.2 million in fees and levies for residence alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This situation could easily be helped by simply putting selection rates for skilled&nbsp;visas back to 2009 levels &amp;#8211; there are plenty of applicants available &amp;#8211; over 1,200 were left in the pool last selection &amp;#8211; but that does not look likely.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Mike&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.move2nz.com&quot;&gt;move2nz.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/move2nz.wordpress.com/477/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/move2nz.wordpress.com/477/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=move2nz.wordpress.com&amp;#038;blog=12518114&amp;#038;post=477&amp;#038;subd=move2nz&amp;#038;ref=&amp;#038;feed=1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;', 'move2nz', '2012-10-06 22:54:50', 'http://move2nz.wordpress.com/2012/03/28/immigration-department-own-goal/', '2012-10-06 22:54:50', NULL, NULL, '0'),
(25, 'A third of New Zealand migrants on benefits?', 'The Immigration Minister has stated that a third of migrants are claiming benefits within 18 months of arrival. This is pretty surprising considering just how many migrants actually can claim benefits within the first two years.', '&lt;p&gt;Yesterday Nathan Guy, New Zealand&amp;#8217;s new Minister for Immigration, stated in an interview with TV One&amp;#8217;s breakfast show that a third of migrants in New Zealand are claiming a benefit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#8217;t know where to start with this one. I had been hoping to stay on a positive footing with this new Minister&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Actually I can&amp;#8217;t imagine (beyond outright racism) what an Immigration Minister could have done to cause more damage to his portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It &lt;em&gt;looks&lt;/em&gt;like Mr. Guy has single-handedly:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;undermined the entire immigration department (which delivers a multi-billion dollar profit to NZ every year); and&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;tried his hardest to scare off as many globally mobile skilled workers as possible.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What makes this statement incredible is that:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The majority (85%) of migrants arriving in NZ each year aren&amp;#8217;t eligible to claim any kind of benefit as they are on temporary visas: temporary workers, students etc.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Of the other migrants &amp;#8211; the ones who would gain residency:\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;60% are not eligible to claim for benefits for the first two years (skilled/business stream);&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;31% are family sponsored meaning that if they claim benefits during the first five years of being in NZ the money is reclaimed from their sponsor&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That leaves just 1% of migrants coming into the country (9% of residents) who can claim benefits during the first two years of being in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It should be mentioned that this group enter New Zealand through the humanitarian stream, many as refugees which effectively form New Zealand&amp;#8217;s international good work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Employment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nMigrants generally cannot get in to New Zealand without a job offer and because of this rates of migrant employment are very high.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefit to New Zealand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nThe immigration department applies a strict set of rules against each application which are aimed at encouraging gain for New Zealand while protecting this country from loss.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For this system to work is must provide a greater benefit to New Zealand than it costs. The latest government research provided in its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.immigration.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/8885A9C8-240F-4E1C-815A-AE1D42F7040E/0/WEB_DOL11570IntMigrationOutlook.pdf&quot;&gt;International Migration Outlook&lt;/a&gt; for 2009/10 confirmed that for 2005/06 (the last time gain was fully calculated by government) immigration delivered $8.1 billion into the New Zealand economy that year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The report confirms that while the New Zealand population of 3.1 million people had contributed $2.83 billion to the economy that year the migrant population of 927,000 (i.e. &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;all&lt;/span&gt; of the migrants including new and those who had been here for many years) had contributed a much greater $3.28 billion.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This clearly confirms that the immigration system, which has not significantly changed since 2006, is working extremely well in providing New Zealand with people who continue throughout their lives to contribute to the economy rather than a mass who claim benefits and drain the system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I have written to the Immigration Minister to ask about these statements and will update once I hear back.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Mike&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.move2nz.com&quot;&gt;move2nz.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/move2nz.wordpress.com/471/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/move2nz.wordpress.com/471/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=move2nz.wordpress.com&amp;#038;blog=12518114&amp;#038;post=471&amp;#038;subd=move2nz&amp;#038;ref=&amp;#038;feed=1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;', 'move2nz', '2012-10-06 22:54:50', 'http://move2nz.wordpress.com/2012/03/07/a-third-of-new-zealand-migrants-on-benefits/', '2012-10-06 22:54:50', NULL, NULL, '0'),
